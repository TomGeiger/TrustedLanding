          Understanding Indexed Universal Life (IUL) Insurance
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground max-w-3xl mx-auto">
          Indexed Universal Life (IUL) insurance is a type of permanent life insurance that offers a death benefit along with the potential to build cash value over time.
          Unlike traditional universal life insurance, IUL policies provide the opportunity for cash value growth linked to the performance of a stock market index, such as the S&P 500Â®.
          This means you can participate in some of the market's gains, often up to a certain cap rate, without being directly invested in the market.
          Crucially, IUL policies typically include a 'floor,' which is a minimum guaranteed interest crediting rate (often 0%), protecting your accumulated cash value from market downturns.
          This combination of potential upside growth and downside protection, along with flexible premium options and tax advantages (like tax-deferred growth and potentially tax-free access to cash value through loans or withdrawals), makes IUL a versatile tool for long-term financial planning, supplemental retirement income, or estate planning.

        Disclaimer: IUL policies are complex financial instruments. Consult with a qualified financial advisor to determine if an IUL policy is suitable for your individual needs and circumstances. Life insurance policies are subject to fees, charges, and surrender charges. Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. Access to cash values through borrowing or partial surrenders will reduce the policy's cash value and death benefit, may increase the chance the policy will lapse, and may result in a tax liability if the policy terminates before the death of the insured.
